# Ticket App
Ticket App using ReactJs, Ionic, Emotion, SwipperJs and Framer-motion.

This repository is a ticket app inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/8257559-Movie-2-0.
You can clone it, test it to see the result, get inspiration from it or pull on if needed, but you are not allowed to use it in real life for your real projects.
